            <h3>The Great Outdoors</h3>
            <p>I am a big nature person, in every season youll find me somewhere other than home spending time in the outdoors, whether it's hiking in the mountains, snowboarding the slopes, picking fresh strawberries and flowers, or swimming at the beach. I have always loved spending time outside, and I will continue to incorporate that into my daily life. I believe that its important for one's happines and health to do so. It is my dream to travel all overe the world and be able to experience the culture and environment of so many unique places.</p>

            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>I take great pride in my health. I have spent a lot of time researching and studying nutrition, ayurveda, and overall health. I originally went to school for neuroscience, and then transitioned to ayurveda and holistic medicine. I decided to take my studies and incorporate them into my lifestyle rather than working within the field. I workout every day for two hours, either at the gym or running in the park. I make sure that I am eating the right diet, currated for me and my personal health.</p>

            <h3>Other Activities</h3>
            <p>I am usually a home body, so I spend most of my free time reading, painting, or writing. Dostoyevsky is one of my favorite novelists, but I have hundreds of books and authors whom I love and cherish dearly. When I do go out and socialize, I am usually with a couple people getting dinner or doing some activity. I meet many people by networking at events and private parties, so I make an effort to maintain and better those relationships. I am also a freelance model, and usually meet a lot of people through that as well.</p>
